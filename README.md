# SafeBurst – Instant Emergency Escape Phrase App

## What It Does
SafeBurst is a futuristic mobile safety app that allows users to trigger emergency actions using a secret voice command or phone gesture (like shaking the device). The app can:
- Trigger a fake phone call
- Send live GPS location to trusted contacts
- Mute all notifications
- Play a soothing sound for anxiety
- Activate other backup actions for safety

## Real-World Problem It Solves
SafeBurst helps users exit dangerous, uncomfortable, or overwhelming situations quickly and discreetly. Use cases include:
- Escaping bad dates or awkward social situations
- Calming panic attacks or overstimulation
- Alerting friends when walking alone at night

## Key Features
- Custom trigger phrase (e.g., "Red Umbrella")
- Fake call from a chosen contact
- Sends live GPS to trusted friends
- Notification mute or soothing sound
- Shake-to-activate backup trigger
- Future AI expansion for detecting stress tone

## Platform and Tools
- **Platform:** Android
- **Builder:** MIT App Inventor
- **Tools Used:**
  - `SpeechRecognizer` – to detect the voice trigger
  - `Notifier`, `PhoneCall`, `Texting` – to perform emergency actions
  - `AccelerometerSensor` – to detect phone shaking
  - `TinyDB` – to store trigger phrases and contacts locally

## How It Works – Step-by-Step
1. User sets a secret escape phrase and selects a trusted contact.
2. When the phrase is spoken aloud or the phone is shaken:
   - A fake call is triggered
   - Live location is sent via SMS
   - The app mutes alerts or plays a calming audio
3. Data is saved in TinyDB for quick reuse.
4. Optionally, user enables “Safe Mode” for instant activation.
